"Total conversion" mod for Skyrim. An entirely new worldspace with new NPCs, new quests, and certainly a unique experience are planned.

Planned is a strong word... I'm open to suggestions and I think this will be fun to do for a while.


Honestly, I'm pretty new to this, so I'm not really focused super hard on skipping the main quest cleanly. I'm sure there's a great way to do that - it's work for another day.


I'm focused currently on building a new world space, getting familiar with the creation kit, good level design practices and story telling / environment building.

This file only relies on Skyrim.esm, but I'm running Special Edition, so I'm not sure about the compatibility for "Oldrim".

If anyone ever sees this, please open new issues! Suggest changes! Submit a pull request!?!?!?!!!!!
